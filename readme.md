### üìù Significant changes in compare to ESX Legacy v1.9.4 (WIP)
* Resolved Lua Lint CI Pipeline Issues: Fixed the problems with the Lua Lint CI pipeline to ensure smooth code analysis and validation.

* Updated Interface Functions: Modified various interface-related functions to utilize ox_lib's modern UIs, such as Notification, TextUI, and ProgressBar. This enhances the user experience and gives a more contemporary look and feel.

* Improved Client-side Event Security: Implemented enhanced security measures for client-side events responsible for receiving players' object data from the server. This focuses on strengthening the events to reduce potential vulnerabilities and abuses.

* Streamlined Player Coordinates Tracking: Overhauled the tracking of player object's coordinates by removing the recursive thread creation approach. The new method maintains backward compatibility while improving efficiency and performance. *(This change becomes more impactful as the number of players increases)*

* Enhanced Context Menu Functionality: Adapted context-menu-related functions to utilize ox_lib's UI while ensuring backward compatibility. This update allows users to continue using the previous esx_context if desired, while benefiting from ox_lib's context UI look.

* Reduced Framework Dependency Resources: This aims to streamline resource allocation by minimizing the framework's dependency resources. **(WIP)**
